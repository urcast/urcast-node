# urcast Raspberry Pi 5 Weather Node README

> A Python-based telemetry collection and diagnostic script designed for the urcast weather station project running on a Raspberry Pi 5. This script validates hardware communication, independent I2C bus splitting, and continuous raw environmental data acquisition.

---

## About the Weather Node

The **urcast Weather Node** runs locally on a Raspberry Pi 5 deployed inside an outdoor protective enclosure. It simultaneously communicates with three separate environmental sensors using isolated peripheral interfaces—utilizing the Raspberry Pi 5's hardware I2C bus, a software bit-banged I2C bus, and a direct single-wire GPIO connection. Each sensor read is wrapped in fault-tolerant exception handling to guarantee that a glitch or failure in one sensor never interrupts the others.

---

## Key Features and Responsibilities

- **Isolated Multi-Bus Architecture:** Communicates with the TSL2591 light sensor via hardware I2C (Bus 1) and the BMP280 pressure sensor via software bit-banged I2C (`adafruit_bitbangio`) on separate pins, eliminating bus contention and speed interference.
- **Fault-Tolerant Error Handling:** Implements independent `try/except` boundaries around every sensor call, returning `None` on failure so the continuous sampling loop remains active.
- **Raw Telemetry Output:** Captures unadjusted base metrics (`ch0`, `ch1`, `lux`, `temperature`, `humidity`, and absolute station `pressure`), leaving derivative math like altitude, dew point, cloud index, and pressure trends to the backend application.
- **Formatted Terminal Diagnostics:** Prints structured, columnar log lines with UTC ISO timestamps and sequential sample numbering.
- **Seamless Provisioning and Token Refresh:** `setup_node.py` checks the saved login, guides the user through login or registration, registers the node, stores the JWT and credentials in `.env`, and the MQTT publisher renews the JWT automatically before it expires.

## Data Fields and Backend Processing Strategy

The node focuses strictly on raw data collection to keep edge operations simple and lightweight:

| Sensor | Reported Fields | Calculated / Derived on Backend |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **TSL2591** | `lux`, `ch0` (Full Spectrum), `ch1` (Infrared) | `visible` ($ch0 - ch1$), `broadband` ($ch0$), gain clipping detection |
| **DHT22** | `temperature` (°C), `humidity` (%) | Dew point, dew point spread, air comfort index |
| **BMP280** | `pressure` (hPa absolute) | Relative sea-level pressure, altitude estimation, pressure trend |

---

## Technology Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.10+
- **Peripheral Libraries:** Adafruit CircuitPython (`board`, `busio`, `bitbangio`, `adafruit_tsl2591`, `adafruit_bmp280`, `adafruit_dht`) with `gpiod` as the Raspberry Pi 5 GPIO backend

- **Commit History:** Track incremental updates, bug fixes, and bus isolation testing across individual commits via the [GitHub Commit Log](https://github.com/leonas-stanis/udp-pi-test-code/commits/main/).


## Getting Started and Installation

### Prerequisites

- A Raspberry Pi 5 running Raspberry Pi OS with I2C interfaces enabled via `sudo raspi-config`.
- Python 3.10 or newer.
- Physical wiring of the TSL2591, BMP280, and DHT22 modules according to the hardware stack pinout table above.
- Access to the urcast API and MQTT broker. Their addresses go in the central `.env` file.

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone or download this repository to your Raspberry Pi 5:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/urcast/urcast-node
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment in urcast-node/:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

`requirements.txt` installs Adafruit Blinka (`board`, `busio`, `bitbangio`), the three sensor drivers, `gpiod` for Raspberry Pi 5 GPIO, `paho-mqtt`, and `python-dotenv`. If pip cannot find a `gpiod` wheel for your Python version, install the matching libgpiod development package from Raspberry Pi OS and retry.

On Raspberry Pi OS, make sure your user can access GPIO:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG gpio "$USER"
```
Log out and back in after changing groups.

4. Create the central `.env` from the template:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Our default API:
```dotenv
URCAST_API_URL=https://urcast.pjmisev.com
URCAST_MQTT_BROKER=urcast.pjmisev.com
URCAST_MQTT_PORT=8883
```

Leave `URCAST_NODE_ID`, `URCAST_NODE_TOKEN`, `URCAST_EMAIL`, and `URCAST_PASSWORD` empty. `setup_node.py` fills them in.

If the node runs on the Pi and the API runs on your laptop, use the laptop's LAN IP, not `localhost`.

5. Run the interactive setup:
```bash
python setup_node.py
```

The setup script will:

- check the saved JWT with `GET /api/auth/me`;
- ask whether to log in or register if no valid login exists;
- register the node when it is missing;
- save the JWT, account credentials, and node id to `.env`;
- start the sensor service in the foreground.

To configure without starting the service, run:
```bash
python setup_node.py --setup-only
```

`.env` is created with owner-only permissions and is ignored by git. Keep it private: it contains the account password and node JWT.

---

## Running and Testing

The recommended entry point is the setup script, which also starts the service:

```bash
python setup_node.py
```

After `.env` is configured, the sensor loop can also be started directly:

```bash
python run.py
```

Press `Ctrl+C` at any time to safely terminate the execution loop and release hardware interfaces.

## Connecting to the urcast API

The node talks to the backend over two transports:

- **REST over HTTP(S)** is used to log in, register the account and node, and verify the saved JWT.
- **MQTT over TLS (port 8883)** carries every reading, diagnostic, and heartbeat. `mqtt_client.py` enables TLS with the Pi's system CA store, so the broker's Let's Encrypt certificate and hostname are verified on every connection. The broker accepts anonymous connections, but the backend reads the JWT from a `token` field inside each payload and drops anything with a missing, expired, or mismatched token.

`setup_node.py` performs the REST steps for you. The manual steps below are for debugging or for provisioning a node without the interactive setup.

### Automatic setup (recommended)

Run from the repository root:

```bash
python setup_node.py
```

The script:

1. Loads `.env`.
2. Calls `GET /api/auth/me` with `URCAST_NODE_TOKEN`.
3. If the token is missing or expired, asks whether to log in, register, or quit.
4. On login, validates the email and password, then writes `URCAST_EMAIL`, `URCAST_PASSWORD`, and `URCAST_NODE_TOKEN` to `.env`.
5. On registration, validates the username, email, and password, creates the account with `POST /api/user`, then logs in and saves the same values.
6. Checks `URCAST_NODE_ID`; if it is missing or owned by another account, asks for the node name, location, and optional coordinates, then creates it with `POST /api/node`.
7. Saves `URCAST_NODE_ID` and the node details to `.env`.
8. Starts `run.py`.

Use `python setup_node.py --setup-only` to stop before step 8.

### What the setup writes to .env

| Key | Source |
| :--- | :--- |
| `URCAST_API_URL` | you |
| `URCAST_MQTT_BROKER` | you |
| `URCAST_MQTT_PORT` | you |
| `URCAST_EMAIL` | login/register prompt |
| `URCAST_PASSWORD` | login/register prompt |
| `URCAST_NODE_TOKEN` | `/api/auth/login` response |
| `URCAST_NODE_ID` | `POST /api/node` response |
| `URCAST_NODE_NAME`, `URCAST_NODE_LOCATION`, `URCAST_NODE_LATITUDE`, `URCAST_NODE_LONGITUDE` | information for database to be filled in manually |
| `URCAST_READ_INTERVAL_S` | you (optional, defaults to `60.0`) |

`.env` is gitignored and is set to owner-only permissions (`600`) on Linux. Do not share it: it contains the account password and node JWT.

### JWT lifetime and automatic refresh

The token is an HS256 JWT and is valid for **24 hours**. The node renews it automatically through `auth_client.py`:

- the token expiry is checked before every MQTT publish;
- when less than one hour remains, the node logs in again with `URCAST_EMAIL` and `URCAST_PASSWORD`;
- the new token is written back to `URCAST_NODE_TOKEN` in `.env`;
- if the API is temporarily unreachable, the old token keeps being used while it is still valid and the refresh is retried every 60 seconds.

This requires the API to be reachable around the refresh time and the stored credentials to remain valid. If the password changes, run `setup_node.py` and log in again to update `.env`.

### Manual registration (optional)

If you already have a JWT and want to register the node non-interactively, set `URCAST_API_URL`, `URCAST_NODE_TOKEN`, and the `URCAST_NODE_*` fields in `.env`, then run:

```bash
python register_node.py
```

The script sends `POST /api/node` with `Authorization: Bearer <token>` and saves the returned `node_id` to `.env`. This path does not prompt and does not refresh the token; use `setup_node.py` for the normal setup.

The API endpoints used are:

- `POST /api/user` with `username`, `email`, `password`
- `POST /api/auth/login` with `email`, `password`; returns `access_token`
- `GET /api/auth/me` with `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- `POST /api/node` with `Authorization: Bearer <token>` and `node_name`, `location_name`, `latitude`, and `longitude`

### MQTT topics

`run.py` continues to print samples to the terminal and additionally publishes:

| Topic | When | Payload |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `urcast/<node_id>/reading` | every sample (~3 s) | `temperature`, `humidity`, `pressure`, `light_level`, `token` |
| `urcast/<node_id>/diagnostic` | every 10th successful reading | `uptime`, `light_sensor_status`, `dht22_status`, `pressure_sensor_status`, `token` |
| `urcast/<node_id>/heartbeat` | every 10th successful reading | `token` |

Sensor failures are sent as `null` (or omitted) rather than a made-up value, and the loop keeps running if the broker is unreachable. The terminal will show `could not send reading (TLS connection to broker failed): ...` and retry on the next sample.

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
| :--- | :--- |
| `No valid urcast login found` | Run `setup_node.py` and choose login or register. |
| Login returns `401` | Check `URCAST_EMAIL` and `URCAST_PASSWORD`; the API reports `Invalid email or password`. |
| Registration returns `400` | The username or email already exists. Choose login instead, or use a different email. |
| Registration returns `422` | The API validation failed; check the printed detail (for example, a password under 8 characters). |
| `Could not reach the API at ...` | Check `URCAST_API_URL` in `.env` and that the API is running. Use the server's LAN IP, not `localhost`, when the API is on another machine. |
| Backend drops readings with `token is missing or wrong for node <id>` | Run `setup_node.py` so the token belongs to the account that registered `URCAST_NODE_ID`. |
| Backend drops readings with `node <id> does not exist` | Run `setup_node.py` to register the node; do not use an id from another node. |
| `could not send reading (TLS connection to broker failed)` | Check `URCAST_MQTT_BROKER` (must be `urcast.pjmisev.com`, kept as a grey-cloud DNS record) and that Mosquitto is listening with TLS on `URCAST_MQTT_PORT` (8883). |
| Nothing arrives after 24 hours | Check that `URCAST_EMAIL` and `URCAST_PASSWORD` are still valid; the node refreshes the JWT one hour before expiry. |
| `URCAST_NODE_TOKEN` or `URCAST_NODE_ID` missing from `.env` | Run `setup_node.py` again. It reuses existing values and fills in missing ones. |
